## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, saturated blue (#3F51B5), evocative of the cinematic experience but not overly bold.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue (#F0F2FA) to provide a neutral backdrop that enhances readability.
- Accent color: A muted purple (#8E24AA), analogous to blue but with enough difference to draw attention to interactive elements.
- Body text and Headlines: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable, and neutral appearance throughout the application.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different content types and actions, with a line art style for a modern aesthetic.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with a focus on usability and easy navigation between form sections.
- Implement subtle animations for transitions and feedback, enhancing the user experience without being distracting.
